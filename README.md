# Extracted JWT Module Class

![Linter workflow](https://github.com/Div685/Ruby-Extracted-JWT-Class/actions/workflows/linters.yml/badge.svg)

## About the Project

The main purpose of this project was to extract a single class from the project. A piece of code I'm proud of and why? 
> I decided to use the `JWT_auth` module class I coded while I was building this API. Why am I proud of this particular class? Well, it's because when I was creating Rails API I didn't have any knowledge about JWT authentication and I had to build user authentication considering the deadline. so I've done some research, read the documentation, and learned JWT authentication from scratch and I was able to implement it in this project. 

This Class has following features:
- created `JWT_auth` module class
- Added `Secret_key` and `Expiry_date` constant
- `Secret_key` and `Expires_In` constant has stored in the credential file.
- Added function to encode the token.
- Added function to decode the encoded token.
- Added function so token can pass through Authorization in API header.
- Added function to check for an authorized user via login method.
- `logged_in_user` method confirmed the decoded token to find the current user.
- To authorize the users, this app uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [Rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors)


## Built With

## How to allow the frontend app to interact with this API
1. Go to puma.rb, located in config/puma.rb, and rewrite the port from 3000 to 3001 like below:
e.g. `port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3001 }`

2. Go to cors.rb, located in config/initializers, and rewrite the origins path for your frontend path in both local and production


## Authentication

- To manage Appointments and items, user needs to login with a username and a password. Then you need to pass token, which is issued when user logged in, Pass the token in the header like below:
`headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
},`
- To manage items, user or administrator needs to log in as a admin.
- To login as a admin Account follow the section below called "How to create admin user".
